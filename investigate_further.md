1. Why can't I break the require.cache fully and get a new instance of my express server using my gulp.watch task?
2. What exactly is a process? Does it get to escape the event loop? Operate on its on loop? If so, how does it pull this off?
3. Releasing NPM module.... also would "mocha-db-cleaner" be of value to people?
4. Look into error handling middleware.... can we rly grab all errors at very end with single 'quadra-arity' function? Should different types of errors be thrown?
